# 24-780B-Engineering-Computation
Code implementations for 24-780B: Engineering Computation, taught by Professor Nestor Gomez in Carnegie Mellon University, fall 2018.
Done in C++, using openGL and fssimplewindow. Some notable projects are mentioned below.

# Individual Project
I implemented a Halloween-themed demo, which can be found in the 'Demo1' folder. Running the ;Halloween_Demo_Setup.exe' file
will play the demo (music is my own composition and recording and can be found at: https://soundcloud.com/blackjawn). 
Here are some screenshots from the demo:

# Group Project
We implemented a fighting game that can be played either in a single player mode, using a simple AI algorithm for the enemy, or 
in a multiplayer mode, with both players using the same keyboard. Code can be found in 'Sticky-Man' folder. 
Each player controls a sticky-man in the window and uses different keys in order to eliminate his opponent. These keys trigger
different player modes: gun mode, knife mode, fighting stance (punch and kick).
